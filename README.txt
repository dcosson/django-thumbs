django-thumbs
5/27/2011

For now, this is exactly the same thumbs.py file as "github.com/Level-Up/django-thumbs.git". It can be used by simply copying the module to site-packages.  

I added a simple setup.py file so it can be installed as a package (i.e. included in a pip requirements.txt file, to make installing a project that relies on it easier).

I may at some point add new functionality or implement sorl-thumbnails as my projects' needs evolve.
